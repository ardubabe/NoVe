# NoVe

NoVe, short for NonVerbal, is a handheld communication aid designed for sex and intimacy, specifically for those who struggle to
communicate verbally due to trauma or disability. 

It works by using an Arduino Nano 33 Sense BLE to pick up the sign language for “yes”, “no” and “maybe”, 
which then triggers an RGB LED to change colour depending what gesture is detected.

The majority of code and process is taken from the Get Started with Machine Learning on Arduino tutorial, found here:
https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/10/15/get-started-with-machine-learning-on-arduino/

I have created my own tutorial as part of my BA in Graphic Communication Design with Creative Computing at Central Saint Martins, 
which can be found here:
*will be linked when finished*

Feel free to make this project for yourself! But please credit me and tag me @ardubabe, i'd love to see!

You're welcome to customise this project to suit your specific needs, what gestures you use, what they mean, the colours associated with them
and the amount of gestures is fully up to you!
